## Getting Started



To get autogenerated code by Playwright kick off the codegeneration (using the command below) and navigate through the use case on the browser.

`$ mvn exec:java -e -Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -Dexec.args="codegen https://www.saucedemo.com/"`


Now use Cucumber and Page Object Model techniques to pass the Playwright `Page` to every class including steps.

To execute the tests :

All scenarios| `mvn clean test`

Specific tagged scenarios| `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @Example"`
```
Under Construction
```
